# Turtle Crossing Game in Python

## Overview

Experience the thrill of the Turtle Crossing Game, a Python implementation using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and the Turtle graphics library. Navigate the turtle safely across the busy road while avoiding obstacles and collecting points. How far can you go without getting hit?

## Features

- Object-oriented design for modular and organized code.
- Utilizes the Turtle graphics library for a visually engaging experience.
- Increasing difficulty as the game progresses.
- Score tracking to challenge yourself and beat your high score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Play

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sepidehkhakzad/TurtleCrossing.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd TurtleCrossing
    ```

3. **Run the game:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. **Controls:**
   - Up arrow: Move the turtle up

5. **Avoid cars and safely cross the road to earn points. The game gets faster as your score increases!**

6. **The game ends if the turtle collides with a car or reaches the top of the screen.**

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Main Python script containing the game logic and implementation.
- `player.py`: Player object class to keep track of the movement of the turtle.
- `cars.py`: Cars object class to keep track of the position of the cars.
- `scoreboard.py`: Scoreboard object class to keep track of the level.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing information about the project.
